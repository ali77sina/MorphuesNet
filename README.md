Fig. 1: MorphuesNet is a resource efficient deep neural net for sleep stage classification, developed to be deployed on commercially available microcontrollers.

The folders contain scripts for each dataset used in the study. 


DOD-H: Dreem Open Dataset, Healthy sub-group. 25 patients classified with single channel EEG. 

**TODO**: add Sleep-edf and physionet 2018 challenge related scripts.
